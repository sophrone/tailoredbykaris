                Welcome to Tailored By Karis, where style meets class. Tailored By Karis was established in 2018. It started under the name Ankara cafe, because of its exquisite ankara fabric designs. As the brand grew and expanded its services to cover bespoke and bridal wears, the brand name was changed to Tailored By Karis. With a passion for craftsmanship and attention to detail, we create stunning pieces tailored specifically for you.
